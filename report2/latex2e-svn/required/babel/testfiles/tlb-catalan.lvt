% This error was not obvious, and in a first sight I couldn't guess
% why it arised. When making tests in spanish I discovered the
% problem: en extra level of braces is added on the fly by babel
% around the argument of shorthands, ie, `" becomes `{"}.
% The spanish.dtx file says $12$'$34$, which
% worked so far but now it is converted to $12$'{$}34$. IIRC,
% a version 3.6 (m, n, o, p, I don't remember) introduced this
% bug but it was fixed later. spanish.dtx now gives an error with
% $f(1,2)=12.34.$ too. Another problematic code would be something
% so simple as $a'$.
% 
% The following should now produce a math-a with double accent.
\testit{$a''$}

% The following should show a math-a with single accent
\testit{$a'$}

% And a math-a with superscript math-a with accent.
\testit{$a^{a'{}}$}
