Description of bug:

Under some circumstances, BABEL goes into infinite loop when some
shorthands are defined. The attached test file demonstrates this.  The
loop occurs on a second run of latex, when the TOC file is being read.
I used `english' option to BABEL to be independent of any other files
(so the meaning of defining a shorthand !` in english is not important
here). The infinite loop disappears as soon as one uncomments a line
`\declare@shorthand{system}{!}{\string!}'. Probably, this is not a bug
but is a `feature', and one should always define system level shorthands
to avoid loops, so I'm sorry if this is the case.

This file demonstrates how such a thing should be defined; it works
with both babel 3.6 and 3.7
