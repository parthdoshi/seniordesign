Description of bug:
Recently I had to read a file line by line. It contained
some german Text. But when typesetting the read Text, the
active character " did not work in and only in the first
line!

After searching in the babel source I found a fix for it: It
seems that the switch @safe@actives seems to be set wrong.
Calling \@safe@activesfalse before typesetting the text
works fine.

The example included generates an inputfile called
`error.in'. You _have_ to remove all lines beginning with a
comment. LaTeX automatically generates some kind of head for
every file inside the filecontents-environment.

\fi
\begin{filecontents}{error.in}
%% Please use an editor to remove all leading comments
%% from this file!!
%%
"a"o"u"s
"a"o"u"s
"a"o"u"s

\end{filecontents}
