>Synopsis:       Infinite loop with active hat in math mode
>Description:
Description of bug:
I noticed this bug while working on the Ethiopian language
support for babel, but I found that it also occurs in the
other languages that activate the hat (^).

The example file will fall into an infinite loop after
encountering the second superscript in the math formula.
I guess the problem arises from the opening brace, at
least I cannot reproduce it otherwise.

In the ethiop package I patched this problem away by
inserting

\declare@shorthand{system}{^}{\csname normal@char\string^\endcsname}

in the style, thereby generating a shorthand at system level,
but I do not really like this solution. I would prefer a patch in
babel itself.

(Just to mention it again: esperanto is just an example
standard language where this problem occurs. It is not special to
esperanto. In fact the same problem occurs with an underscore, but
only the ethiop package activates the underscore, so I would have
to complain to myself in this case ... :-)

My analysis:
Babel correctly detects that the ^ is followed by
an unsafe character and \system@active^ is called.

Here we notice that no shorthand is available. No problem.

But now \@sh@^@sel is invoked which decides that it has to
invoke \system@active@arg^ thereby forgetting that we had 
just  decided that it is not safe to peek at the following
token. 

\system@active@arg^ now does a \peek@token which decides 
that it is not safe to peek at the token and again calls 
\system@active^.

The problem probably lies in forgetting that we must not
peek ahead.

Is the call to \@sh@^@sel required?
