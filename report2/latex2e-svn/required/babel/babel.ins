%    Make some arrangements to use docstrip files in subdirectories
%    unchanged...
%    To do this I need to insert a path in front of the source file
%    name, for this purpose I need to save the definition of an
%    internal docstrip macro:  
\let\ds@@from\@from
%
%    Then it is convenient to have a special command to load docstrip
%    files in subdirectories, it takes the directory path in the first
%    argument, the name of the file in the second: 
\def\BblInstallSubDir#1#2{%
  \def\WriteToDir{contrib/#1/}%
  \def\@from##1{\ds@@from{contrib/#1/##1}}
  \batchinput{contrib/#1/#2.ins}
  \let\@from\ds@@from}
%
%   When a flat distribution is used a much simpler command
%   is needed.
\def\BblInstallFlat#1#2{%
  \batchinput{#2.ins}}

%    Now choose which installation to use.
\let\BblInstall\BblInstallSubDir %% For now...

\def\BblInstallBase#1{%
  \def\WriteToDir{base/}%
  \def\@from##1{\ds@@from{base/##1}}
  \batchinput{base/#1.ins}
