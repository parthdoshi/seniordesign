>Description:
Description of bug:
plain based formats fail to load the active characters
code defined in plain.def. I have tested this problem
with several language support files and all fail in the same
spot. babel.def and plain.def are loaded succesfully but
the run dies while loading the remaining .ldf code. It happens
even with english.ldf (?!).

I have tracked the bug to line 157 of babel.def. The conditional
branch in the definition of |\@initiate@active@char| is not working.

>How-To-Repeat:

Sample file which indicates the problem:
========================================
\fi
%&plain
%
% test file modified from PR babel/2216
%
\input spanish.sty
\selectlanguage{spanish}
\begindocument

\noindent
These standard-TeX constructs:

\'a  \'e  \'\i{} \'o  \'u  \~n
\'A  \'E  \'I    \'O  \'U  \~N
\"u  \"U
\raise1ex\hbox{\underbar{\sevenrm o}}
\raise1ex\hbox{\underbar{\sevenrm a}}
\guillemotleft{}
\guillemotright{}

\noindent
can be obtained using these equivalent spanish babel shorthands:

'A  'E  'I  'O  'U  'N
'a  'e  'i  'o  'u  'n
"U  "u  "o  "a  "<  ">

\noindent
The spanish letter, \~n and \~N, can also be obtained using the
spanish babel shorthand ~n and ~N, but a tilde between two letters
(other than n) inserts a space of fixed length like~here or~{}n.
