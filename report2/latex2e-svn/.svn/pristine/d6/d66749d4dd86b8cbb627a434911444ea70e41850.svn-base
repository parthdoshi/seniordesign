The file 3976 has full explicit paths converted (tentatively) from
(c:/path/file.ext to (.../file.ext

The following files won't pass the test :

* 3015: Requires bib files, which are missing.

The following files pass the test, but they have some issue:

* 3156: It shows in fact another bug -- american pattern with british
  date. Very likely too late to be fixed, but perhaps it should be
  documented or a warning added: "english should not be the main
  language with local options american, UKenglish, etc."

* 3992: Requires a font for hebrew currently not available in most
  distributions, but it passes thanks to a dummy font (the bug is
  related neither to the font nor to hebrew).
