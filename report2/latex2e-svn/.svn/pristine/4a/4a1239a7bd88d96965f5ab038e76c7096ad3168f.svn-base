>Description:
Description of bug:
	The command \textquotedblleft that is used
in 'estonian.sty' (and in several other language styles)	
has not been defined for Plain TeX. An easy fix
is to add the command
\DeclareTextSymbol{\textquotedblleft}{OT1}{92}
to the end of 'plain.def', where other textsymbols
are declared.
