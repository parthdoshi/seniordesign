% \section{Introduction}
% 
% There are certain symbols which were in use in ancient Greece and which
% are of use to scholars even today. These symbols are various forms of
% qoppa and stigma, and the letter digamma. These special symbols are
% provided by the \texttt{cb} fonts which are now the official fonts for
% the \texttt{greek} option of the \texttt{babel} package. Moreover, these
% fonts provide a few more symbols such as a symbol for Euro, etc. The `tao'
% symbol although is not a greek symbol, survives mainly for reasons of
% compatibility. This little package provides access commands for these 
% symbols. The package can be used only in conjunction with the |greek| 
% option of the |babel| package.

% \section{The Implementation}
%
% First comes the identification part.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<*package>
\ProvidesPackage{grsymb}[1997/09/21\space v1.0]
\typeout{Package: `grsymb' v1.0\space <1997/09/21> (A. Syropoulos)}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Next we check to see if the |babel| package is loaded with at least
% the |greek| option. In case it isn't, we opt to produce an error message.
%    \begin{macrocode} 
\@ifpackagewith{babel}{greek}{}{%
     \PackageError{grsymb}{%
     `greek' option of the `babel'\MessageBreak
      package hasn't been loaded}{%
      The commands provided by this package\MessageBreak
      are specially designed for greek language\MessageBreak
      typesetting with the `babel' package. Load\MessageBreak
      it with at least the `greek' option.}\relax
      }
%    \end{macrocode}
% Now, we proceed with the definitions of the various symbols. Please note
% that |\ddigamma| is intensionally spelled erroneously, in order to avoid
% conflicts with the command |\digamma| that is defined by the package
% |amssymb|. Although the tao symbol is not a greek symbol, it is included
% mainly for reasons of compatibility.
