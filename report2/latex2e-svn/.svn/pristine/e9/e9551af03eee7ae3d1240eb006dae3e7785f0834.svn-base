% ** (7)  DH  90/06/29: oldlfont.sty shouldn't be read in twice to
%         avoid math group overflow.
%         FMi 90/06/29: fixed.
% 
% ** (26) RmS 91/11/22: euscript.sty does not work without amstex.sty option.
%         FMi 91/11/22: Missing code added.

% ** (2)  FMi 90/04/05: \makelabels in letter will cause an error because \xpt
%         is redefined to \@preamerr after \document.
%         FMi 90/06/03: Fixed by redefining \xpt inside \xpt. (v1.1j lfonts.doc)

% ** (19) DWu 91/03/03: The combination of twoside, \pagestyle{headings}
%         and newlfont.sty results in slanted page numbers on every second
%         page. This is again the result of mixing LaTeX 2.09 styles with
%         the font selection scheme.
%         Temp. fix: delimit the scope of \sl in the heading macros with
%         an extra set of braces. The standard styles will be updated soon.
%         FMi 91/09/28: corrected with the new release of LaTeX 2.09

% ** (18) FMi 90/10/12: FJe reported that changes to \baselinestretch
%         in the preamble do not affect the setting of \baselineskip.
%         FMi 90/10/12: Fixed by forcing a reinitialisation in

% ** (50) BRa ???: Changing only \baselinestretch has no effect.

% ** (5)  MDo 90/06/08: An \hbox{\small ...} in vertical mode will be
%         placed into the vertical list using the \baselineskip current
%         inside the box not the one outside the box.  Temp. fix: use
%         extra braces to keep the change from \small local.  Final fix
%         will move part of the code from \gbl@settings into \selectfont.
%         FMi 90/06/24: fixed.

% ** (13) DH  90/07/10: In fam.doc a missing percent in \sub@fontshape
%         could produce an extra space if a font is loaded in horizontal
%         mode.
%         FMi 90/07/11: fixed.
% 
% ** (28) RBa 91/05: \series etc. should get different names because they may
%         be used in mathematical work.
%         FMi 91/11/27: Changed to \fontfamily, \fontseries, \fontshape and
%         \fontsize. Old names are still supported but shouldn't be used any
%         longer.

% ** (16) FMi 90/10/02: Dr. David Love reported that \paragraph{Test} {\sl AB}
%         would produce a bold slanted heading the newlfont option.
%         This is actually not an error of the font selection scheme but
%         a problem with LaTeX 2.09. If the newlfont option is used, it is
%         necessary that at some places in a style file all font parameters
%         are specified. Currently the LaTeX styles specify only \normalsize
%         \bf in headings.  In this case one has to reset the wrong font
%         parameter by hand, e.g., \paragraph{\normalshape Test} in the
%         case above.  As similar problem will arise when a footnote is
%         encountered during the scope of \sf etc.  This problem will
%         vanish with the new LaTeX. 
%         FMi 91/09/28: corrected with the new release of LaTeX 2.09

{\sl slant head?}
% ** (17) DH  90/10/04: It seems better to substitute cmti for cmu fonts
%         which are not available since this font is mainly used for the
%         \pound symbol. (Who likes to get pounds converted to dollars in
%         a footnote?)
%         FMi 90/10/09: Changed.
% 
% ** (21) SLe 91/03/25: \$ no longer worked as superscript in math.
%         Fixed 91/03/27 FMi: added extra braces around definition. Did
%         the same for \pounds and \copyright.

% ** (36) FMi 92/03/21: Macro \text was renamed to \nfss@text to make it
%         internal because people complained that the name is too
%         common. The style file amstext.sty will redefine this to
%         behave like the \text macro in amstext. This means that people
%         who wish to use \text need to load amstext.sty in the
%         \documentstyle command.

%
The \verb=\text= macro is
\ifx\text\undefined un\fi
defined.
