% test file for PR 2708
% Description of bug:
% The problem is with defining of \LaTeX and \TeX in both LGRenc.def
% and LWNenc.def. 
% The reason is collision of definition for the logos in the above files.
% Pay attention, that changing of
%     \DeclareTextCommandDefault{\TeX}{\textlatin{\ltxTeX}}
% in LGRenc.def and LWNenc.def to
%     \def\TeX{\textlatin{\ltxTeX}}
% doesn't help, so the problem is not with \DeclareTextCommandDefault.
%
% My general thought about the problem: we have to move such common for many
% languages things to the babel's kernel, thus preventing possible collisions.
% In addition, font encoding switching mechanism can (and should) be improved.
%
% These days I'm writing hebrew language definition for babel, and
% in addition to the Right-to-Left/Left-to-Right problems, unique for the
% semitic languages, hebrew have it's own encoding. Therefore, good encoding
% support is a must. I'll write about these issues in a couple of days
% (by private e-mail)
