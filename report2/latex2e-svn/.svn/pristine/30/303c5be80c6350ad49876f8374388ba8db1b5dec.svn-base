%115.  A figure or table environment appearing between paragraphs (in
%vertical mode) can produce extra vertical space in the document between
%those paragraphs.  (Discovered by Arthur Ogawa.  Corrected 26 May 87.)
%
%116.  An obscure bug in the \caption command can cause it to leave
%extra vertical space above the caption if the command is not
%preceded by a blank line.  This extra space does not appear
%when a \nofiles command is used.  (Discovered by Peter Schilling.
%Corrected 12 Jun 87.)

%%%% Are the vertical spaces correct?

\section{First section}

\subsection{First subsection: its title is very long to produce a
multiple-line entry in the table of contents}

\subsubsection{First subsubsection: its title is very long to produce 
another multiple-line entry in the table of contents}

See the table of contents on page~3.

%73.  Multiple paragraph marginpar's don't work.  (Corrected
%16 July 85.)
%
%128. A marginal note is misplaced if there is a footnote preceding
%it on the same page.  (Found by Chris Rowley.  Corrected 26 Feb 88.)
%
\vspace{35mm}

\bugid{73--128}

This a footnote\footnote{First footnote} preceeding a marginpar.

And another one in the very paragraph where the 
marginpar\footnote{Second footnote} is used,%
\marginpar{This is a multiple paragraph margin note.\par
Here is the second paragraph: A marginal note might be misplaced 
if there is a footnote preceding it on the same page.

Last (dummy) paragraph of the margin note}
will any of them break marginpar?

%99.  A page break can occur where a figure or table environment or a
%\marginpar command appear, even in the scope of a \samepage declaration.
%(Found by Oren Patashnik.  Corrected 23 Oct 86)
%
%%%% It is NOT completly corrected is it?

{\samepage
\bugid{99}

This is still printed on the first page, the figure is on the second one.

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \framebox[100mm]{\rule{0mm}{10mm}}
 \caption{Another framebox}
\end{figure}

This sentence should be printed on the first page.
}

%102.  If no blank line follows a paragraph-making environment, then the
%following text is not indented.  However, a \noindent command produced
%an outdent.  (Correction, similar to #99, made on 23 Oct 86)
%

\bugid{102}

$$\sin\pi=0$$
\noindent Check the indentation. Correct: not indented!

%131.  If, for a counter foo, \thefoo is defined to contain mention of a
%non-preloaded font, then a \label{bar} command that involves counter
%foo will write some garbage on the .aux file causing an error on a
%\ref{foo} command.  (Reported by Peter K. Schilling.  Corrected 20 Jul 88.)
	
\bugid{131}

% Use a non preloaded font (preload.min is in use!)
\renewcommand{\theequation}{{\sf\Alph{equation}}}
%%%% Something strange: \ref causes a "missing control sequence" only when
%%%%this new definition of \theequation is in use...

\nonstopmode

\begin{equation}  e^{i\pi} = -1 \label{euler} \end{equation}
Equation~(\ref{euler}) is called Euler equation.%
 
%133.  If the output routine is called while in a tabbing environment,
%strange things can happen because \-, \', etc.  have unusual
%definitions.  (Reported by Detlev Droege and Friedrich Haubensak.
%Corrected 4 Aug 88.)
%
%134.  Redefining something like \thefigure to include a size-changing
%command like \small causes an error when a \ref referes to a label that
%labels a figure environment.  This problem can be solved by using
%\protect\noexpand\protect\small instead of \small.  I'm not sure
%if this is a bug, and I doubt if I'll fix it.  (Reported by Peter
%Schilling.)
%
%135.  The \pagebreak and \nopagebreak commands have no effect
%inside a tabbing or eqnarray environment.  (Reported by Mik Bickis.)
%
%%%% It's true!

\vspace{100mm}

\bugid{133--135}

\begin{tabbing}
If \= it's raining      \\
  \> then \= put on boots \\
  \>      \> take hat;    \\ \nopagebreak
  \> else \> smile.       \\
Leave house.
\end{tabbing}

The \verb|\pagebreak| (and \verb|\nopagebreak|) commands DO HAVE NO EFFECT
inside a tabbing or eqnarray environment.  (Reported by Mik Bickis.)

%156. A \label command in math mode that follows a space command
%like \, causes an error.  (Discovered by Charles Karney, corrected
%18 Dec 89.)

\bugid{156}

$x=y\,\label{E1}$

% List of figures and table of contents

\listoffigures

\tableofcontents

%132.  If a \contentsline or \addtocontents command immediately precedes
%an \include, then the table of contents line it produces may appear
%later than the contents lines added by the included file.  There does
%not appear to be an easy fix for this.
%(First reported by Rainer Schoepf and Frank Mittelbach)
%
%%%% I have not been able to reproduce this bug (described as not fixed)

%\bugid{132} %moved to file addcontents.tex
