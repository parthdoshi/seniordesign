\chapter{The beginning}

You  have just finished your years as a student at the local adventurer's
guild.  After much  practice  and  sweat  you  have  finally  completed  your
training  and  are  ready to embark upon a perilous adventure.  To prove your
worthiness, the local guildmasters have sent you into the  Mazes  of  Menace.
Your  quest is to return with the Amulet of Yendor 
\cite{aa,ab,ac,ad,ae,af,ag,ah,ai,aj,ak,al,am,an,
ao,ap,aq,ar,as,at,au,av,aw,ax,ay,az,ba,bb,bc,bd}

According to legend, the
gods will grant immortality to the one who recovers this  artifact;  true  or
not,  its recovery will bring honor and full guild membership (not to mention
the attentions of certain wealthy wizards~\cite{be}).
