 German umlauts in UTF-8: ^^c3^^a4^^c3^^b6^^c3^^bc  

\inputencoding{latin1}  % switch to latin1

 German umlauts in UTF-8 but read by latin1 (and will produce one
 error since \verb=\textcurrency= is not provided): ^^c3^^a4^^c3^^b6^^c3^^bc

\inputencoding{utf8}    % switch back to utf8

 German umlauts in UTF-8: ^^c3^^a4^^c3^^b6^^c3^^bc


Some codes that should produce errors as nothing is set up 
for them: ^^c3F ^^e1^^a4^^b6

And some that are not legal utf8 sequences: ^^c3X ^^e1XY
