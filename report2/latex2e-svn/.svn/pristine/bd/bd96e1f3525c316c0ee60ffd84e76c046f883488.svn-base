% Test file for LaTeX2e bug report #2642.
% Large Floats in twocolumn may give empty column on next page.

% The following macro \MuchArbitraryText just produces a large amount of
% numbered sentences to give us enough text to let the float float in.
% First a counter for the sentences to show that no text is lost.
\newcounter{sentence}
\renewcommand{\thesentence}{\arabic{sentence}}
%
\newcommand{\AT}{\stepcounter{sentence}%
                 This is sentence number \thesentence. }    %   1 sentence
\newcommand{\mat}{\AT\AT\AT\AT\AT\AT\AT\AT\AT\AT}           %  10 sentences
\newcommand{\MAT}{\mat\mat\mat\mat\mat\mat\mat\mat\mat\mat} % 100 sentences
\newcommand{\MuchArbitraryText}{\MAT\MAT\MAT}               % 300 sentences
% Added by Chris:
\newcommand{\LessArbitraryText}{\MAT\MAT}                   % 200 sentences

% Now, construct a height such that our float will occupy nearly one page:
\newdimen\NearlyTextheight
\NearlyTextheight=\textheight
\addtolength{\NearlyTextheight}{-\dblfloatsep}
\addtolength{\NearlyTextheight}{-\baselineskip}

% Finally ensure that such large floats may occur on a page
\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{.99}

% Our figure -- just a large frame:
\newcommand{\LargeFigure}{\fbox{%
                              \rule{0pt}{\NearlyTextheight}
                              \hspace*{0.7\textwidth}
                               }
                          }

\START

\showoutput

\begin{document}
\twocolumn
A bit text preceding the declaration of the float.

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \LargeFigure
\end{figure*}

And now a lot of text to fill the pages: \MuchArbitraryText

% Added by Chris

 The twocolumn case works differently for different sizes.
 Unfortunately this first case produces a misleading warning in
 addition to the correct one: does this matter?
 
 \twocolumn[\LargeFigure]
 
 And now a lot of text to fill the pages: \LessArbitraryText
 
 But if we make the box one line smaller, so that it would be allowed as a
 normal float, everything works fine.
 
 \twocolumn[\LargeFigure
            \vskip -\baselineskip
            ]
 
 And now a lot of text to fill the pages: \LessArbitraryText
 
\end{document}
