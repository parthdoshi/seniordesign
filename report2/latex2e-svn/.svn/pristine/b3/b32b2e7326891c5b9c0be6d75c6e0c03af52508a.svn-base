\STYLEOPTIONS{}

% Optionally declare commands which are (or might be)
% defined in this `module' of LaTeX.  Each command declared
% will be recorded in the .tlg file as Defined, Undefined,
% or Relaxed (ie \let to \relax, which LaTeX treats for most
% purposes as being undefined)
%
\declare@command\ds@twoside

This is `front matter' and will not appear as a slide.
