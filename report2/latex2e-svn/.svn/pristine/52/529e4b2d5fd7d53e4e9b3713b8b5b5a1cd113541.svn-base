This is a wide figure labelled~\ref{Fig1}

\begin{figure}[hp]\label{Fig1}
\begin{center}
\framebox[3in]{\rule{0pt}{0.5in}}
\end{center}
\caption{First wide figure}
\end{figure}

Will it be printed? The following one is narrow

\begin{figure}[hp]\label{Fig2}
\begin{center}
\framebox[1in]{\rule{0pt}{0.5in}}
\end{center}
\caption{Narrow figure}
\end{figure}

and should be printed here. Another wide one:

\begin{figure}[hp]\label{Fig3}
\begin{center}
\framebox[3in]{\rule{0pt}{0.5in}}
\end{center}
\caption{Second wide figure}
\end{figure}

That's all for this column.

Second column, with another narrow figure
