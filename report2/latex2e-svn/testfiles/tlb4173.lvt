\title{Bug with the showkeys package}
\author{Ari Meir Brodsky}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This document displays a bug with the \verb+showkeys+ package.  
The bug appears when using \verb+showkeys+ version 3.15.  
It seems to be caused by the \verb+\@inlabelfalse+ command 
near the end of the \verb+showkeys.sty+ file.
Also, using the \verb+[notcite]+ option prevents the bug from appearing.

\begin{theorem}\label{T:1}
This is an ordinary theorem.  

There is no problem here.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{T:2}\cite{abc}
This theorem begins by citing a bibliography item.  The phrase ``Theorem 2" is missing entirely!
\end{theorem}

Notice that we can still refer to Theorem~\ref{T:2}.

\begin{theorem}\label{T:3} \cite{def}
This theorem also begins by citing a bibliography item.

Now it has a second paragraph.  The phrase ``Theorem 3" has shifted to the beginning of the second paragraph.  
And wow, it says ``Theorem 2" here as well, unless the \verb+amsthm+ package is loaded!
\end{theorem}
