Synopsis:       Encoding changes for maths fonts

When the encoding of a maths (symbol) font changes, a warning is sent to the 
console output. Naive users think this is a problem with their code, and 
package writers locally patch the font warning system to bypass this 
behaviour.

Since the encoding change itself isn't a harmful act and not showing the 
warning will have no harmful side-effects nor compatibility problems, I'd like 
to suggest sending the warning to the log file instead.
