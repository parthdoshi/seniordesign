\def\demo#1{\hbox to 1pt{#1}}
\demo{\uppercase{\'e^^d7}} %%% \'e is ^^d7 in KOI encoding
{\fontencoding{T1}\demo{\uppercase{\'e^^d7}}}
\demo{\uppercase{\'e^^d7}} %%% this is broken because changes to lc/uc
%				  %%% codes were done \global in t1.def !!!
\fontencoding{KOI} %% now this thinks we are in KOI and so .def file ain't read
\demo{\uppercase{\'e^^d7}} %%% and this remains broken as a result of that.
%%%%%%% and now another try:
\fontencoding{T1}\fontencoding{KOI} %% first make nfss reload .def file
\demo{\uppercase{\'e^^d7}}  %% back in normal situation
{\fontencoding{T1}\demo{\uppercase{\'e^^d7}}\fontencoding{KOI}}
\demo{\uppercase{\'e^^d7}} %%% now it works fine
\fontencoding{KOI}
\demo{\uppercase{\'e^^d7}}
