We have a comprehensive traffic flow model that simulates the journey from your
location to the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. It requires you to input data
about your fuel type (diesel or gasoline) and mileage (MPG) because both these
factors are the main determinants of a carâ€™s carbon emissions and encompass other
factors including age, make, engine size, etc. Furthermore, it also uses current data
from the Google API to find the congestion on both the roads to estimate your cars
idling time, which can greatly effect your emissions, as well as the time taken to
complete your journey. Then it provides you with the alternative of taking SEPTA,
providing congestion information about the train, as well as various routes from
all the SEPTA stations in the vicinity of your zip code. We believe that by showing
you a direct comparison of the time taken, carbon emissions and traffic congestion
between driving and taking SEPTA will convince you to help the Philles Go Green!
