					<h2>Our Motivation</h2>
		<hr>

		Stadium Traffic is dedicated to reducing the carbon footprint due to fans attending sports games in the Philadelphia Area. Recently, there has been a significant push by Philadelphia's sports teams to become more environmentally friendly by launching programs such as the Eagles "<i>Go Green</i>" initiative and Philles "<i>Red Goes Green</i>" initiative. 

		<br> <br>

		We believe that traffic emissions, specifically those due to large amounts of time spent idling when entering or leaving the stadium, are a major contributor to the total emissions produced by the stadium and therefore have the potential to be greatly reduced. 

		<br><br>

		The objectives of our project are:
		<ol>
		<li>Develop a comprehensive model of transportation to and from the stadium.</li>
		<li>Quantify the total emissions due to transportation to and from games.</li>
		<li>Optimally route exiting vehicle traffic out of the stadium.</li>
		<li>Inform fans of the change in travel time and carbon emissions by using public transport rather than cars.</li>
		</ol>

		<br><br>
