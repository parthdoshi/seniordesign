<h2>3. Strategic Plan</h2>

<p>The driving principle behind our strategic plan can be summarized as "Benchmark, then improve." Our project will therefore first focus on computing 'sensible' emissions values for an average game, and will then develop a full model to quantify the impact of different policies that could be put in place. In engineering terms, we are first calculating the equilibrium or "trim" condition and then we will focus on disturbances away from it.</p>


<h3>3.1 System Proposed Approach</h3>

<p>The approach to both problems will of necessity be similar, and our aim is to design our solution to the first problem with a great deal of flexibility so that it may be readily adapted for use in the second phase of the project. Our phase 1 model will have five main components that correspond to the four steps of the UTMS plus a GHG calculator. The blocks described below correspond to the block diagram shown in figure 1.</p>

<p><ul>
 <li><b>Trip Generation</b> We will need to gather data on the geographic distribution of the fans that attend the games. We hope to obtain a good amount of data from the Eagles to aid in this section. Absent that data, we will have to resort to theoretical models commonly used in the industry, such as the Gravity Model. We will also be gathering data on timing of the trips, either through direct observation, or ideally from already existing records.
 </li><li><b>Trip Distribution</b> This step in the modeling is straightforward, since we know that fans are traveling to and from the stadium (or a nearby parking lot).
 </li><li><b>Mode Choice</b> This phase involves matching each trip in the database to a mode of travel (i.e. Car vs. SEPTA vs. Bus). We plan on using parking-lot data to estimate car use, and, if possible, get station-level information directly from SEPTA. A variety of theoretical models exist to help validate the gathered data. {Transportation Engineering Basics, 2nd Edition By A. S. Narasimha Murthy, Henry R. Mohle}
 </li><li><b>Trip Assignment</b> Is the selection of the specific lines, streets, highways, and stations that each trip will follow. At this stage, we will break the model into subsystems for each of the possible means of transportation.
  <ul>
   <li> <b>SEPTA Trains</b> A great deal of information is available on the website regarding lines and schedules that we have used to build a software representation of the network. With some well-established linear optimization algorithms, we will be able to model the exact path taken for every trip assigned to SEPTA trains.
   </li><li> <b>Buses</b> Schedules and stops are also available at www.septa.org, and we will merge this database with the information available on Google Maps to obtain location data. There are also well-established algorithms we can use to model the paths of every trip.
   </li><li> <b>Cars</b> Our car model will be split in two: 
     <ol>
     <li> At a "micro" level, we will model the road network in and around the stadium parking lot based on existing databases complemented with hand-input data that we extract from maps and planning documents. This portion will be used to model the exiting cars, since we believe the congestion at the end of a game results in substantial GHG emissions. </li>
     <li> At a "macro" level, we will use the same TAZs as in the trip generation phase, and calculate a sample path to the stadium based on highways and main roads. We will have to encode the network of such roads and use our own algorithms. Alternatively, depending on the resulting number of TAZs, and subject to special authorization, we could use the Google Maps API to programmatically retrieve routing information.</li>
     </li></ol>
 </ul>
 </li><li><b>GHG Calculator</b> This subsystem will be a memoryless function mapping a trip to an estimated emissions value. Our preliminary assumption is that trips taken on public transit contribute no additional GHG, since we are taking the bus and train schedules as given. For cars, there are a multitude of published methods for estimating emissions. We will have to estimate a fleet profile (average age and size) to use one of these models. We expect that it will be a function of total highway distance/time, local street distance/time, and idling time. When properly built, the output from this subsystem will be our first main deliverable!
 </li>
</ul></p>

<p>For the second phase of the project, as mentioned above, we will seek to leverage as much of the modeling work from phase one as possible. The goal for this phase will be to focus on converting the existing model into a usable simulator. A key objective will be incorporating a variety of inter-system feedback mechanisms that will allow for more a accurate model. There will of course be a trade-off between complexity and accuracy at this stage that we will have to explore. Since there may be limited opportunities to validate our model (until the next season begins), a key performance metric will be the consistency of results, which in technical terms, means that the system should reject small disturbances in the inputs. Conceptually, changing the base fare for SEPTA or increasing the cost of parking by small amounts should not result in wildly different behavior. This sensitivity will be a key measure we will use in determining the right level of complexity to build into the model.</p>

<p>Some examples of feedback mechanisms we are considering at this stage are:</p>

<p><ul>
 <li><b>Congestion Effects</b> If a fan spends 45 minutes stuck in the parking lot unable to move, we expect that fan to be more likely to take the train for the next game. A more detailed discussion of the fan model lies below.
 </li><li><b>Scheduling Effects</b> If SEPTA notices trains traveling fuller on game days, they may choose to alter schedules in the future.
 </li><li><b>Uncertainty Effects</b> As fans try different modes of transportation, they may refine their predictions of travel times and convenience.
 </li><li><b>Fleet Composition Changes</b> We suspect the fans that are most likely to start using public transit may have cars with above-average fuel efficiency, whereas the fans that take their trucks to tail-gate parties will likely continue to use their less-efficient cars. These effects would alter the fleet profile and hence average emissions calculations.
 </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Regardless of what feedback loops we ultimately incorporate, we will have to build a model of the fans' utilities, to capture the effects of the various incentive schemes on trip generation profiles. At this stage we expect we will be using an agent-based technique for this subsystem, which will have as inputs the TAZs and some demographic data. Cooperation from the Eagles will be important in fine-tuning this part of the model.</p>

<p>The expanded model can be seen in the block diagram in figure 2. We have included the incentive structure as an input in the diagram. We expect to make a GUI for this input to the model.<p>

<h3>3.2 System Specification</h3>

<p>Our end system must have a GUI that can be used by Eagles management to input proposed incentives and that will output the projected change in GHG. The input must be intuitive and friendly enough that it does not require a manual for a user of average computer literacy to learn to use it in 10 minutes or less. Additionally, once a user is familiar with the interface, varying parameters on a proposed incentive program should not require more than 2 minutes of the user's time.</p>

<p>The back-end must be flexible and have a documented API so that a software developer may write extensions to the model (e.g. different incentive types) or refine submodules (e.g. a more efficient traffic assignment subsystem) without having to modify the other components of the software. Additionally, the model must be fast enough so that initial estimates of GHG emissions under certain incentive schemes may be computed within 5 minutes. In addition, detailed logs and reports (e.g. emissions over time graphs) should be accesible to a more knowledgable user through the same GUI.</p>

<p>The program must handle improper input robustly and must be able to deal with excpetions and errors gracefully. Specifically, a user of average computer literacy should be able to understand error messages, and, in a worst-case scenario, should be able to simply reset the application to restore functionality.</p>

<p>The subsystem specifications are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Trip Generation</b> The module will have to interface with a database of TZAs and, if possible, a database of sanitized user data in strict XML format. It must output a list of trips specifying the origin and time of each one. This module should not take more than 5 seconds to generate 50,000 trips (excluding loading time).
</li><li><b>Trip Distribution</b> This module must pass through the list from the trip generation module.
</li><li><b>Mode Choice</b> This module will have to read in sanitized parking-lot data in SQL as well as station-level usage information and TZA demographic profiles. It must accept the list from the trip distribution module and assign a mode choice to each entry in the list. Its output will be a vector of the different trips in each category and some summary statistics for each mode (e.g. utilization percentage). It should not take more than 10 seconds to assign choices for 50,000 trips (excluding loading time).
</li><li><b>Trip Assignment</b>
   <ul>
  <li><b>SEPTA Trains</b> This module must read in a line and schedule XML database and accept an input of trip origin and time pairs. For each trip, it will have to calculate the most direct path to the stadium, subject to its capacity constraints. It must then compute summary statistics to be output along with the trip list. It should not take more than 1 minute to route 50,000 trips (excluding loading time).
  </li><li><b>Buses</b> The requirements for this module are identical to that of the SEPTA Trains module.
  </li><li><b>Cars</b> The two car modules together should take more than 1 minute to route 50,000 trips (excluding loading time).
    <ol>
     <li> The "Micro" module should accept the list of trips and must read in a database of the road network in and around the stadium. It must then compute total time per car to reach the highways/main roads as well as total idling time.</li>
     <li> The "Macro" module should accept the same list of trips as the "Micro" module and should compute total highway and secondary road times across all trips. Optionally, it will have to interface with the Google Maps API.</li>
     </ol>
   </li>
</ul></li><li><b>GHG Calculator</b> This subsystem will have to process the outputs from the trip assignment modules and compute an overall level of GHG emissions. This module should not take more than 10 seconds to run for 50,000 total trips.</li>
 </ul>
