1. Markdown Heading 1
======================

I left a blank line, and am now writing text.

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines, with no indentation.


2. Heading Twos are "underlined" with dashes
---------------------------------------------

I left two blank lines above the heading. Block quotes follow:

> Never have so many owed so much to so few blah 
> more text, etc.

Bulleted lists use bullets, then dashes, then pluses:

* First level of list
* Another item
  
  To make a multi-paragraph bullet, (why??) indent the first
line by 3 spaces.
* A third item
  - This item has subitems
  - Subitems are indented by two spaces
    + A third level of listing
    + I added an additional two spaces

You can of course also write ordered lists with any kind of number

1. First item
2. Second item
  i. first sub-item
  ii. second sub-item
    (a) The punctuation choice is up to you
    (b) But the additional two spaces of indentation continues
