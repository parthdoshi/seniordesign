SEPTA Subsystem
================

 * First step was building the station model
   + Relied on Google Maps and septa.org publicly available data
   + Parking information, connecting lines, geographic coordinates
 * Station model used to run SEPTA subsystem
   + Take trip profiles (TZA & time)
   + Assume people travel shortest distance
     (Simple network flow LP -- several algorithms)
   + Use feedback to ensure capacity constraints met
   + Output summary statistics
     - Utilization by segment
     - Arrival time distribution
     - Total users
