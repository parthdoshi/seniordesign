Full System
============

Designed in two phases

1. Current GHG calculation
   * Based on standard 4 stage traffic model + 5th stage
     1. Generation: From where?
     2. Distribution: At what time?
     3. Modal choice: Using what method?
     4. Assignment: What are the specific routes used?
     5. GHG: What are the emissions from each route?
   * Significant data gathering
     + Parking lot data
     + SEPTA usage data
     + Average fleet profile
2. Scenario simulation of GHG emissions
   * Incorporate "macro" feedback
     + Congestion: "too crowded"
     + Scheduling SEPTA changes schedules on game-day
     + Fleet changes: tailgaters need trucks
