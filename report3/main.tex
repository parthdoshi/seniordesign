\section{Equipment/Fabrication/Software Needs}
We do not have any need for specialized equipment or software. The
software we will be using is either publicly available, or available
at Penn. We expect that our production version of the model will not
depend on commercial tools.

  API & Application programming interface. An official, documented way
  for a program to access a database or another program, such as that
  of Google Maps. \\
  DOM & Document Object Model. A file format that is very easy to
  parse and yet human-readable. \\
  EPP & Emissions per passenger. \\
  EPM & Emissions per mile. \\
  GHG & Greenhouse gases. We mostly mean Carbon Dioxide, but we use
  the term GHG since emissions are highly correlated across types in
  this application. \\
  HBO & Home-based other. A category of trips in the
  standard  model. Contrast with HBS, HBW, NHO, and NHW. \\
  HBS & Home-based shop. A category of trips in the standard
  model. Refers to trips from the home to go shopping. Contrast with
  HBO, HBW, NHO, and NHW. \\
  HBW & Home-based work. A category of trips in the standard
  model. Refers to trips from the home to go to work. Contrast with
  HBO, HBS, NHO, and NHW. \\
  MAG & Maricopa Association of Governments. It is in charge of
  transportation planning for Phoenix and it surroundings. \\
  NHO & Non-home-based other. A category of trips in the standard
  model. Contrast with  HBO, HBS, HBW, and NHW. \\
  NHW & Non-home-based work. A category of trips in the standard
  model. Refers to trips not from the home to go to work. Contrast
  with HBO, HBS, HBW, and NHO. \\
  SEPTA & Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority. Manages the
  commuter rail, the subway, trolley, and bus systems in and around
  Philadelphia \\
  SQL & A type of database that is commonly used. \\
  TAZ & Traffic analysis zone. Used in modeling the UTMS. It involves
  dividing a geographical area into units that have sufficiently
  similar transit and demographics to treat as one for the purposes of
  the model. \\
  UTMS & Urban Transportation Modeling System. A commonly used
  framework to model traffic demand and flows. \\
  XML & Extensible markup language. A structured file format that is
  human-readable and easily parseable and customizable. \\

\section{Financial Information}
We expect our project to incur minimal cost. At this time, the only
foreseeable expenses are the cost of transportation to the
stadium. Depending on how we refine the user needs after our meeting
with the Eagles, we may have to purchase a mobile device on which to
prototype our model interface.
